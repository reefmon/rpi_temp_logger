Raspberry Pi Temperature Logger
===============================

This repo contains code for a Raspberry Pi temperature logger which uses SQLite to store data read from a DS18B20 sensor.
sqlite3 is required. Run this prior to running these scripts:

sudo apt-get install sqlite3

You should use sqlite to create a new templog.db file:

sqlite3 templog.db

In the sqlite shell, enter these commands:

BEGIN;
CREATE TABLE temps (timestamp DATETIME, temp NUMERIC);
COMMIT;

After you have entered in those commands, exit the sqlite shell by entering in:

.quit

Use these commands to place the db in the /var/www/ directory and to set permissions:

$ sudo cp templog.db /var/www/
$ sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/templog.db

Place the monitor.py script file in /usr/lib/cgi-bin/ and apply proper permission once it been copied over:

$ sudo chmod +x /usr/lib/cgi-bin/monitor.py 
$ sudo chown www-data:www-data /usr/lib/cgi-bin/monitor.py 

Set a cron job:

$ sudo crontab -u www-data -e

With the following paramters for database updates every 15 minutes:

*/15 * * * * /usr/lib/cgi-bin/monitor.py

This should get you started. Place the webgui.py file in the same /var/lib/cgi-bin directory. You may need to setup apache to allow for
handling of cgi-bin .py files, which is unfortunately beyond the scaope of this README.
